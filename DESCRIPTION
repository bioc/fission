Description: This package provides a SummarizedExperiment object of
        read counts in genes for a time course RNA-Seq experiment of
        fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) in response to
        oxidative stress (1M sorbitol treatment) at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120
        and 180 mins. The samples are further divided between a
        wild-type group and a group with deletion of atf21. The read
        count matrix was prepared and provided by the author of the
        study: Leong HS, Dawson K, Wirth C, Li Y, Connolly Y, Smith DL,
        Wilkinson CR, Miller CJ. "A global non-coding RNA system
        modulates fission yeast protein levels in response to stress".
